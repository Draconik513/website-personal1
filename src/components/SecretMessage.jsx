          <p>
            My love, you are the calm to my storm, the melody in my silence, and the warmth in my coldest nights. Every second with you feels like a dream I never want to wake up from.
          </p>
          <p>
            I know life may throw challenges our way, but I promise to hold your hand through every one of them. Your happiness is my mission, and your love is my reward. You make me believe in forever, and I want to spend mine with you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thank you for loving me, for choosing me, and for being the most beautiful part of my every day. I love you more than words could ever say â€” to the moon, the stars, and all the galaxies in between.
          </p>
          <p>Forever yours,</p>
