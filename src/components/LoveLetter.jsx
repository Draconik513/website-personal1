      <h2>My Dearest Love,</h2>
      <p>
        From the moment you entered my life, everything changed. You brought light into places that were once dark, hope into moments that felt hopeless, and love into a heart that was searching.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your laughter is my favorite melody, your presence my greatest comfort. I find peace in your arms, strength in your voice, and purpose in your smile. No words could ever truly capture the depth of my feelings for you — but I promise to spend every day trying.
      </p>
      <p>
        I cherish every conversation, every look, every quiet moment we share. You make even the ordinary feel extraordinary. Loving you has been the greatest adventure of my life, and I can’t wait to see where this journey leads us next.
      </p>
      <p>
        Always and forever,
      </p>
